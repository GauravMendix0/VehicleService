# 🚗 Vehicle Service Application

A Spring Boot REST API for managing **Vehicle Owners**, **Vehicles**, and **Service Appointments**.

It includes endpoints for CRUD operations, stores data in an in-memory H2 database, and has JUnit tests for controller logic.

---

## 📌 Features

- Manage entities: Owner, Vehicle, and ServiceAppointment
- RESTful API architecture
- In-memory H2 Database with console access
- Unit tests using MockMvc & JUnit 5
- Auto-creation of tables using Spring Data JPA

## 🗄️ Tables in H2 Database

On application startup, the following tables are auto-created:

| Table Name             | Fields                                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `owner`                | `oid`, `name`, `contact`                   |
| `vehicle`              | `vid`, `model`, `type`, `owner_id (FK)`    |
| `service_appointment`  | `aid`, `description`, `vehicle_id (FK)`    |

> ⚠️ Relationships:
- One `Owner` → Many `Vehicles`
- One `Vehicle` → Many `ServiceAppointments`

## 🧪 Sample Data to Insert

If using H2 Console (`http://localhost:8080/h2-console`), run the following queries to test the API:

```sql
-- Insert sample owner
INSERT INTO OWNER (oid, name, contact) VALUES (1, 'Gaurav', '1234567890');

-- Insert vehicle for owner
INSERT INTO VEHICLE (vid, model, type, owner_id) VALUES (1, 'Honda City', 'Sedan', 1);

-- Insert service appointment for vehicle
INSERT INTO SERVICE_APPOINTMENT (aid, description, vehicle_id) VALUES (1, 'Oil change', 1);

## 📂 API Endpoints

### 🔹 Owner APIs

| Method | Endpoint       | Description            |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| GET    | `/owners`      | List all owners        |

| PUT    | `/owners/{id}` | Update owner fully     |
| PATCH  | `/owners/{id}` | Update owner partially |
| DELETE | `/owners/{id}` | Delete owner by ID     |

> 🧪 Similar APIs can be implemented for `/vehicles` and `/appointments`.

## 🧪 Running Unit Tests

```bash
./mvnw test
```

Tests cover:

* All basic CRUD API flows for `Owner`
* Using `@WebMvcTest`, `@MockBean`, `MockMvc`
